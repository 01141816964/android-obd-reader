android-obd-reader is an android application that will connect to bluetooth Elm327 OBD readers and display and upload live data.

Ideally this will split into an obd library that is independent of the android platform.

This is my first android app so I'm sure it is rough around the edges.

I used pyobd (http://www.obdtester.com/pyobd) and this wikipedia entry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs) as reference.

This has only been tested on a handful of vehicles and with only one bluetooth device, input from others would be very helpful.  There is a limited set of commands implemented here, I would like to expand this.  The diagnostic commands have not been tested in anyway.
